# NIMA: Neural Image Assessment

'NIMA' is a trained model for predicting how good(technically) or attractive(aesthetically) an image is.

This is a Keras implementation of the paper [NIMA: Neural Image Assessment(2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05424.pdf) by Hossein Talebi and Peyman Milanfar. You can find an introduction from [Google Research Blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/12/introducing-nima-neural-image-assessment.html).
